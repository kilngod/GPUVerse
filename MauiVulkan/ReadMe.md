## KilnGod's Multi-Platform Vulkan Demonstration Library

ILGPU project has been looking for ways to support high performance rendering along with high performance Computing. We would like to visualize dynamic fluid simulations while not having to rewrite rendering code for each platform.

This solution is an illustration for the ILGPU team on how to Vulkan for both simulation and rendering..

## Maui Vulkan
The original GPUVulkan library was not statically linked. This library is to make the conversion from dynamic to static linking of the original library to better support stores which do not allow static linking.
