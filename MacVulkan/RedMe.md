# MacVulkan

The MacVulkan library is identical to GPU Vulkan library, its just packaged to allow use with the MacOS platform.

Ideally this library should be consolidated with the GPUVulkan library provided we find a way for the MacVulkanApp to call this library.

See GPUVulkan for more information.
